# pyOpenGL-RGB-3D-cube

## Installation

Code was tested on Python 3.10.
I suggest creating virtual env for this project and installing dependencies after activation.

> Virtual environment can be created using `venv` by executing
> ```shell
> python3 -m venv venv
> ```
> and activated by
> * Windows: ```source venv/Scripts/activate```
> * Linux: ```source venv/bin/activate```

To install all required modules run:
```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements
```

## Running
The Cube can be run by executing in a shell command in `src` directory:
```shell
python3 ./cube.py 
``` 

## Rotation

To rotate the cube use `Q`,`E`,`W`,`S`,`A`, and `D` keys.
